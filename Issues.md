- White Flashing
When clicking from opportunities to hire talent and vice versa, I can see on the background and the logo for example that there is still a quick but smooth white flashing. 

but the everthing should continue as it is (beside the cards from teh menu that change obviously):

The background animation should really continue without interruptions or flashing etc..  

Please read the read me first and then lookup astro documentation on why our implementation is causing this.

- The animation on the when hovering over the job-tag is instant. I don't know why.f
